==================

Various scripts and whatnot for CI and CD on upstream projects and Fedora
Linux (probably also other distributions in that universe).  This is meant
as a toybox and you copy what you want in to different projects.

An example project using these files is rpminspect:

      Scripts that help with CI and CD work on Fedora projects.

      * release.sh

            Given a project on Github and built with meson, give the ability
            to increment the minor version number, tag (signed), push, and
            create a release on Github.  The release tarball and detached
            signature are uploaded to this release entry too.  All steps are
            optional and controlled by command line arguments.

            Requirements:  - Project hosted on github
                           - meson.build file, so using meson to build
                           - Version number in an x.y style using ints
                           - GPG key set up
                           - GitHub access token in ~/.githubtoken

      * srpm.sh

            Given a project that is set up to build in Copr[1], short-circuit
            the process to locally generate an SRPM file that Copr would use.
            Useful to locally test in mock before pushing to Copr.

            Requirements:  - Project using Copr, preferably with dotcopr/

      * mkrpmchangelog.sh

            Generates a file suitable for use as the %changelog section in
            an RPM spec file.  The generated changelog goes to stdout and
            should be saved to a file.  It is easiest to call this file
            'changelog' and then make it be a Source file in the spec file.
            Then at the end of the spec file, do:

                %changelog
                %include %{SOURCE1}

            Assuming you made it Source1.  By default the script will generate
            a changelog block from the previous tag to the current tag.  But
            if you pass --copr it will generate a simple changelog suitable
            for builds in Copr.

            This script is called by srpm.sh as well.

      * submit-koji-builds.sh

            Automatically build Fedora packages on specified branches in
            dist-git.  This is called by the for-meson/Makefile when you do
            "make koji".  The first argument is the tarball which represents
            the new release.  The second argument is the project name.  The
            project should also have a spec file template that generates in
            the release process.  This script also assumes you are using the
            mkrpmchangelog.sh method.

            Requirements:  - Fedora account for building (member of packagers)
                           - FEDORAPROJECT.ORG krb5 ticket
                           - fedpkg and git installed

            The calling environment should set BRANCHES to the names of the
            dist-git branches to build on.  By default this is just 'master'.

* for-meson/

      Things to help meson projects present a more common build interface.

* dotcopr/

      Things that go in a .copr/ subdirectory in your project.

      Makefile

          A .copr/Makefile template for projects on Github and carry a
          spec file template in the project.  Read the Makefile to see
          the variables it tries to replace in the template to generate
          a spec file.

          Requirements:  - Project using git
                         - RPM spec template as PROJECT.spec.in
                         - The instpkgs.sh script below

      instpkgs.sh

          Determine whether or not to use yum or dnf then use the correct
          one to install git and the BuildRequires listed in the spec
          file.  Called by the srpm target in the Makefile.

          Requirements:  - RPM spec template as PROJECT.spec.in
