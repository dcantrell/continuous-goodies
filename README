==================

Various scripts and whatnot for CI and CD on upstream projects and Fedora
Linux (probably also other distributions in that universe).  This is meant
as a toybox and you copy what you want in to different projects.

TOUR

* release.sh

      Given a project on Github and built with meson, give the ability to
      increment the minor version number, tag (signed), push, and create
      a release on Github.  The release tarball and detached signature are
      uploaded to this release entry too.  All steps are optional and
      controlled by command line arguments.

* srpm.sh

      Given a project that is set up to build in Copr[1], short-circuit
      the process to locally generate an SRPM file that Copr would use.
      Useful to locally test in mock before pushing to Copr.

* dotcopr-Makefile

      A .copr/Makefile template for projects on Github and carry a spec
      file template in the project.  Read the Makefile to see the variables
      it tries to replace in the template to generate a spec file.
